# Test Post-Commit LLMS Integration

This test verifies that LLMS sync happens after commit completion.

The system should:
1. Complete the original commit first
2. Then create a separate commit for LLMS updates

## Updated Content

This is additional content to trigger LLMS sync in post-commit hook.
The sync should detect this change and create a separate commit.

## Debug Test

Adding more content to force a meaningful change that should trigger LLMS updates.
This should definitely create changes in the llmsData directory.

## Final Test

After removing auto-staging from SyncDocsCommand, this should now create a separate commit for LLMS updates.
