The `llms.txt` file is automatically generated using:

```bash
pnpm docs:llms
```

This combines all relevant documentation into a single, comprehensive reference optimized for LLM consumption.

## Usage for AI Assistants

When working with the Context-Action framework:

1. **Start with**: Review the [Complete Integration Guide](./llms.txt) for full context
2. **Reference**: Use specific API documentation for detailed method signatures
3. **Follow**: Adhere to conventions outlined in the integration guide
4. **Implement**: Use the patterns and examples provided

The integration guide is designed to provide LLMs with complete context about the framework's philosophy, patterns, and implementation details in a single reference document.
