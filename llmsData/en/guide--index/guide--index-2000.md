Code Patterns

Collection of essential patterns for the Context-Action framework, focusing on RefContext and useWaitForRefs functionality. Core Patterns

RefContext Setup
Basic setup pattern for RefContext with proper TypeScript types and provider integration. Conditional Await
Core behavior of useWaitForRefs that conditionally waits or returns immediately based on element mount state. Wait-Then-Execute
Pattern for safely executing DOM operations after ensuring element availability. Real-time State Access
Pattern for avoiding closure traps by accessing current state in real-time using store.getValue(). Timeout Protection
Pattern for protecting against infinite waits with timeout mechanisms and retry logic. Usage Guidelines

Each pattern includes:
- ‚úÖ Best practices with working examples
- ‚ùå Common pitfalls to avoid
- üéØ Use cases for when to apply the pattern
- ‚ö° Performance considerations and optimization tips

Pattern Composition

These patterns can be combined for complex scenarios:
- RefContext Setup + Conditional Await for basic element waiting
- Real-time State Access + Wait-Then-Execute for race condition prevention
- Timeout Protection + any pattern for robust error handling.
