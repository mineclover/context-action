LLMS Generator - Architecture & Implementation Guide

LLMS Generator - Architecture & Implementation Guide System Architecture The LLMS Generator is a TypeScript library for processing documentation and generating optimized content for LLM consumption. This guide provides comprehensive architecture details and implementation patterns. Core Components 1. Document Processing Pipeline 2. Clean Architecture Implementation The system follows Clean Architecture principles: - Entities: CoreTypes (Document, WorkItem, Priority metadata) - Use Cases: Commands (WorkNextCommand, LLMSGenerateCommand, PriorityTasksCommand) - Interface Adapters: CLI Adapters - Frameworks & Drivers: CLI entry point, File system 3. Directory Structure Design Patterns Applied 1. Factory Pattern - CommandFactory: Creates command instances based on user input - Enables easy addition of new commands without modifying core logic 2. Adapter Pattern - Adapts existing command implementations to new interfaces - Maintains backward compatibility while improving architecture 3. Strategy Pattern - Document Selection Strategies: Balanced, Greedy, Hybrid, Quality-focused, Diverse - Allows runtime algorithm selection based on requirements 4. Dependency Injection - Commands receive configuration through constructor injection - Improves testability and reduces coupling Configuration System Enhanced Configuration Management Priority Management System Priority Task Types 1. üî¥ missing: Priority.json files are missing 2. ‚ùå invalid: JSON syntax errors or missing required fields 3. üü° outdated: Source documents modified after priority.json 4. üü† needsreview: Priority scores don't align with standards 5. üîµ needsupdate: Metadata is incomplete Priority Calculation Algorithm Performance Optimizations Code Optimization Results - CLI Entry Point: 2000 lines ‚Üí 200 lines (90% reduction) - Commands: 30+ files ‚Üí 13 core commands (56% reduction) - Modular Architecture: Single responsibility per module - Type Safety: 95% coverage with TypeScript Processing Efficiency - Change Detection: Only process modified files - Batch Operations: Group related operations - Intelligent Caching: Reuse analysis results - Parallel Processing: Multiple file processing where possible Quality Assurance SOLID Principles - S: Each class has single responsibility - O: Open for extension, closed for modification - L: Interface substitution guaranteed - I: Interface segregation prevents unnecessary dependencies - D: Depend on abstractions, not concretions Testing Strategy - Unit Tests: Core functionality testing - Integration Tests: Command interaction testing - Dry-Run Support: Preview changes before applying - Validation: Pre-operation validation checks Migration & Compatibility From Legacy CLI - All core functionality retained - Commands remain backward compatible - Configuration format unchanged - Output format consistent Breaking Changes - None - full backward compatibility maintained Best Practices Command Implementation Error Handling Integration Patterns Git Hook Integration CI/CD
