Essential Hooks

These hooks are fundamental to using the Context-Action framework. Most applications will need these. ðŸ”§ RefContext Hooks (Performance)

createRefContext<T>()
Factory function that creates all ref-related hooks for high-performance DOM manipulation. - Purpose: Creates type-safe direct DOM manipulation system with zero React re-renders
- Returns: { Provider, useRefHandler, useWaitForRefs, useGetAllRefs }
- Essential for: Performance-critical UI, animations, real-time interactions

useRefHandler()
Primary hook for accessing typed ref handlers with direct DOM manipulation. - Purpose: Get ref handler for specific DOM element with type safety
- Essential for: Direct DOM updates without React re-renders
- Pattern: Performance layer bypassing React reconciliation

useWaitForRefs()
Utility hook for waiting on multiple refs to mount before executing operations. - Purpose: Coordinate operations requiring multiple DOM elements
- Essential for: Complex DOM initialization sequences
- Pattern: Async ref coordination

ðŸŽ¯ Action Hooks (Core)

createActionContext<T>()
Factory function that creates all action-related hooks for a specific action context. - Purpose: Creates type-safe action dispatch and handler system
- Returns: { Provider, useActionDispatch, useActionHandler, useActionRegister }
- Essential for: Any action-based logic

useActionDispatch()
Primary hook for dispatching actions to handlers. - Purpose: Get dispatch function to trigger actions
- Essential for: Component interaction with business logic
- Pattern: ViewModel layer in MVVM architecture

useActionHandler()
Primary hook for registering action handlers.
