❓ FAQ

Q: When should I use Store Only vs Action Only vs RefContext vs Composition. - Store Only: Pure state management (forms, settings, cache)
- Action Only: Pure event handling (logging, tracking, notifications)
- RefContext Only: High-performance DOM manipulation (animations, real-time interactions)
- Composition: Complex business logic requiring multiple patterns (user management, interactive shopping cart)

Q: Is the renaming pattern mandatory. Yes, the renaming pattern is a core convention of the Context-Action framework. It significantly improves type safety and developer experience. Q: How should I approach performance optimization. 1. Choose appropriate comparison strategy for stores
2. Memoize handlers with useCallback
3. Use reference strategy for large data
4. Apply debounce/throttle when needed
5. Use RefContext for performance-critical DOM operations

Q: How should I handle errors. 1. Use Pipeline Controller's abort() method for actions
2. Set up domain-specific Error Boundaries
3. Handle different error types appropriately
4. Provide user-friendly error messages
5. Always check ref.target existence before DOM manipulation

Q: Should I use explicit generics or type inference. - Type inference (recommended): For most cases, code is concise and type safety is guaranteed
- Explicit generics: For complex type structures or strict type constraints

Q: When should I use comparisonOptions. 1. ignoreKeys: When you want to ignore specific field changes like timestamps
2. customComparator: When special comparison logic is needed for business requirements
3. maxDepth: To limit deep comparison depth for performance optimization
4. enableCircularCheck: When dealing with objects that might have circular references

Q: How should I write type tests. 1. Test both explicit generics and type inference
2. Verify type safety at compile time
3. Document error cases with comments
4. Write test components that reflect actual usage patterns
5. Include RefContext type validation in component tests

Q: When should I use RefContext over regular state. - Use RefContext when: Direct DOM manipulation needed, 60fps performance required, zero re-renders critical
- Use regular state when: Data needs to be displayed in UI, component re-rendering is acceptable
- Combine both when: Performance-critical operations alongside data display (e.g., real-time charts)

Q: How do I ensure RefContext safety. 1. Always check ref.target existence before DOM operations
   

2. Use useWaitForRefs for operations requiring multiple refs
   

3. Implement proper cleanup for animations and event listeners
